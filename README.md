### What I learned

This was really awesome, challenge, It did took a little bit extra time
to make everything working perfect but I lear a lot of things while building
the great awessome Calculator.

The one basic thing which I learned after the project completion, if you
have a proper planning (before starting actual code) how to do your project,
than it can save a lot of your time & can help you to make your project more
efficient.

### Continued development

After this project, I will make sure (try) to do a proper planning before
starting any project.
